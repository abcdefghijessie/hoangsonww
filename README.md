# Hello, World! 👋 I'm David Nguyen!

I'm a Computer Science and Economics double major at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (*formerly Case Western Reserve University*), with a minor in Data Science. From May 2023 to August 2023, I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at VNG Corporation - one of the largest tech companies in Vietnam and in Asia, and I specialized in full-stack web development and video-streaming platform development for the company. This is also my most recent work experience. Please visit my portfolio website at https://hoangsonww.github.io/My-Portfolio-Website/
