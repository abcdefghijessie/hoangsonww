I'm a student at **The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill**. From May 2023 to August 2023, I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at **VNG Corporation** - one of the largest tech companies in Vietnam and in Asia, and I specialized in full-stack web development and video-streaming platform development for the company. This was also my most recent work experience.
